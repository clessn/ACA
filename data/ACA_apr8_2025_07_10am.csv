1. Presentation


The project is being led by Shannon Dinan and Yannick Dufresne, professors in the Department of Political Science at Université Laval, as well as by Catherine Ouellet, professor in the Department of Political Science at Université de Montréal.


We are now seeking your consent to participate in an online survey. Before agreeing to participate in this research project, please take the time to read and understand the following information. This document explains the purpose of this research project, its procedures, benefits, risks and drawbacks.


2. Nature of the survey


The objective of this survey is to measure attitudes, voters’ political behaviour and other individual characteristics as they relate to the budget.


3. Context of the study


This research project is financed by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council.


4. Participation procedure


Participation will consist of completing a ten-minute online survey. You will be presented with a series of 35 questions about your attitudes, political behaviour and other individual characteristics related to budget choices. You will also be asked to provide some socio-demographic data.

5. Benefits, risks or drawbacks


Benefits: A benefit of participating in this survey is to contribute to the advancement of knowledge about the factors influencing budget preferences. Participants who complete the survey will also receive compensation in the form of Leo points, as explained below.


Risks: There are no major risks associated with banking. Your participation is confidential. Your name will not be stored, and you will be identified by a number that cannot be traced back to you. In accordance with Léger Opinion’s policies, researchers have no access to any data that could identify you.


Disadvantages : There are few drawbacks to this survey. One drawback is the time required to complete the survey.

6. Voluntary participation and right of withdrawal


Although the answers to each question are important for the research, you are free to choose not to answer any of them, or to end your participation at any time by closing your browser window. Since no personally identifiable data (e.g. name, contact details) will be collected by the questionnaire, data obtained from a participant who chooses to withdraw from the project after submitting his or her questionnaire cannot be destroyed.

7. Anonymity and data storage


The answers collected through this survey will only be made available to the researchers anonymously. It will therefore not be possible to identify participants. However, with your specific consent, research data may be stored in a database for future use in other academic research projects by the Centre for Public Policy Analysis and associated researchers. The data will be used strictly for academic research to understand voters’ political behavior and individual characteristics in relation to public policy. Survey data is stored on VALERIA’s institutional servers at Université Laval. The estimated storageperiod is 30 years. The approximate destruction date of the data is 2055.
